# Promises in JavaScript

A **Promise** in JavaScript is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Promises provide a cleaner, more flexible way to handle asynchronous code compared to traditional callback functions.

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of creating and using a promise:

```javascript
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Asynchronous operation
  let success = true; // This is just an example condition
  if (success) {
    resolve("Operation was successful!");
  } else {
    reject("Operation failed.");
  }
});

promise
  .then((message) => {
    console.log(message); // "Operation was successful!"
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error); // "Operation failed."
  });
```

## Chaining Promises

Promises can be chained to handle multiple asynchronous operations in sequence:

```javascript
doSomething()
  .then((result) => doSomethingElse(result))
  .then((newResult) => doThirdThing(newResult))
  .then((finalResult) => {
    console.log("Final result:", finalResult);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error occurred:", error);
  });
```

## Promise Methods

- `Promise.all()`: Waits for all promises to be resolved or any to be rejected.
- `Promise.race()`: Waits for the first promise to be resolved or rejected.
- `Promise.resolve()`: Returns a promise that is resolved with a given value.
- `Promise.reject()`: Returns a promise that is rejected with a given reason.

## Conclusion

Promises are a powerful tool for managing asynchronous operations in JavaScript, making code easier to read and maintain.
